Axial Piston Pump 
Axial Piston Pump is a positive displacement pump. It consists of pistons, barrel, sliders, 
swashplate, shaft, valve plate (Inlet-Outlet port). To make pumping mechanism function, one 
can use swashplate or bent axis pump. Here displayed model is swash plate variable axial 
piston pump. In this pump, piston rotates and repeatedly reciprocates (back-and-forth motion) 
within the rotating cylinder. Reciprocate motion of pistons are controlled with slippers and 
shoe-retainer plate and pistons position inside the cylinder vary with the swashplate angle. 
The change in swashplate angle changes stroke length (BDC-TDC), which changes the 
holding capacity of hydraulic fluid in the cylinder. As the gap between the end of a particular 
piston and the valve plate is reduced, the chamber becomes shorter and hydraulic fluid is 
expelled through the valve plate and comes out through flange. 
Working principle 
In the first half rotation of the pistons within the cylinder pistons moves Top Dead Centre (TDC) 
to Bottom Dead Centre (BDC). In this half rotation void in the cylinder lengthens. This vacuum 
draws hydraulic fluid through valve plate into the chamber. The other half rotation piston 
moves BDC to TDC within the cylinder and hydraulic fluid drawn out from the valve plate. The 
valve plate acts as a separator between the input and output flow of the pump. 
Since the rotation of the piston and cylinder is determined by the rotation of the shaft, the 
output of the pump can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the speed of the shaft. 
Swashplate design allows for more control of the pump by adjusting the angle of the 
swashplate and changing the distance of the piston from the valve plate to increase or 
decrease the size of the chamber available within cylinder to hold hydraulic fluid.
